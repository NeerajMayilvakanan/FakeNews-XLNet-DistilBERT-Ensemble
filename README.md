# FakeNews-XLNet-DistilBERT-Ensemble
This research uses XLNet and DistilBERT for fake news detection, applying ensemble methods (Simple Average and Majority Vote) on Politifact and GossipCop datasets. XLNet excels in Politifact, while ensembles boost accuracy, especially in celebrity news detection.

## üìä Dataset

The study uses two datasets from the FakeNewsNet repository:

- **Politifact**: Fact-checked political articles.
- **GossipCop**: Celebrity news and gossip articles.

### Data Split:
- **80% Training**  
- **10% Validation**  
- **10% Testing**

This split ensures models generalize well on unseen data and are rigorously evaluated.

## üß† Models Used

- [XLNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08237)
- [DistilBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01108)
- **Simple Average Ensemble**: Averaged predictions of XLNet & DistilBERT.
- **Majority Vote Ensemble**: Class prediction by majority agreement.

## üìè Evaluation Metrics

The models were evaluated using:
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1 Score**

These metrics were calculated separately on validation and testing datasets.
